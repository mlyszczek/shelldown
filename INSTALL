This project uses standard autotools to build and install. In case when
there is no configure script file (like when you clone from git) first run:

$ ./bootstrap.sh

After that configure script will be created and you can run:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Use "./configure --help" to see all available compile options and optional
features.
